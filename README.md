# Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Project 3 - Arcade Game (Frogger like)

## Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

Project number 3 from Udacity Front-End Web development is related to classic arcade games. As games contains a lot of elements that are easily converted to objects, this project intends to give the student the ability to handle classes and objects in Javascript and also to have experience manipulating the canvas.

## Goals

- Hands-on with Javascript Classes and Objects
- Experience with more complex Javascript project
- HTML5 Canvas manipulation

## Instructions
### How to install and run the game
Just download all files from this project and start index.html file

### How to play the game
TODO: Provide instructions of how to play the game

## Instructions (As provided by Udacity)

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
